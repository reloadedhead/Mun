# Mun

Mun is a proof of concept on how Munich can actually have a public transport app that doesn't suck. Using the endpoints discovered by [@mondbaron/mvg](https://github.com/mondbaron/mvg), this app is written entirely in SwiftUI and provides extremely basic functionality, such as checking nearby stations and looking for stops.
